# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 23rd March, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises on github learning.

**Thoughts** I've done a bit of coding in the past and used github a bit, but only really to store code. I wanted to start by learning to use github properly, how to work with issues, pull requests etc.

### Day 2: 24th March, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started coding in python using Azure Notebooks.

**Thoughts** I've been thinking about what to focus on for this challenge. I want to get more comfortable with writing code, but not sure of what area. Data Science / Machine Learning is something I have been interested in for a while, so thought I'd do a few days of that.
